\begin{abstract}
This Research-to-Practice Full Paper critically evaluates the
perceived value offered by the computer science degree accreditation
scheme of a large professional body/learned society based in the
UK. The value and relevancy of degree accreditation in computing and
engineering-related disciplines remains contested in many
jurisdictions, especially in the context of graduate employability and
higher education institutions needing to ``better meet the needs of
industry and society''. The degree accreditation process has been
criticised for being overly burdensome and bureaucratic; adversarial
rather than enhancement- led; simultaneously too hard and too easy to
obtain; perceived as focused on generating revenue for the accrediting
body rather than providing value to the discipline; and for being
colonial and paternalistic if the accreditor is not from the same
jurisdiction as the institution being accredited. Equally, the value
presented by degree accreditation has been cited as a kitemarking
exercise, promoting international graduate mobility and a globally
portable workforce; highlighting internationally recognised standards;
focusing on outcomes and raising output standards; promoting and
disseminating best practice; ensuring industry relevance of curricula;
and even reigniting the debate on the need for a “licence to practise”
in certain areas of IT and software engineering. However, it is
unclear which of these various perceptions dominates in term of
stakeholder, from across academia, professional body/learned society,
industry, government, the wider public and indeed learners themselves.

However, taking into consideration the potentially divergent
requirements and perceptions of these various stakeholders, it is the
academic institution that chooses to (or to not to) seek accreditation
of the degree programmes they offer; as such, this research study
primarily focuses on the perceptions and experience of academic
faculty. It draws from across the career ladder and academic hierarchy
in the UK, from early-career junior faculty, through to tenured
professors and senior leadership. Furthermore, this takes place in the
context of evolving international accreditation processes, such as
AHEP4 and EQANIE.

This study thus addresses two key research questions in the context of
UK computer science degree accreditation:\\

\begin{enumerate}[i)]
\item What are perceived to be the key aspects of value presented by
  degree accreditation processes?
\item What are perceived as the key challenges for future degree accreditation processes.
\end{enumerate}

This work adopts a mixed methods approach, drawing on the quantitative
and qualitative findings from a national-level survey in 2021 of
computer science faculty in the UK, collected through a convenience
sampling approach. It is augmented by in-depth focus groups and
semi-structured interviews with representative UK faculty identified
through purposive sampling. The outcomes of this wider study provides
deeper insights into the current perceived value of computer science
degree accreditation in the UK, as well as making a number of
recommendations across policy and practice for how it may change in
the near future. In doing so, it presents a rationale for improved
articulation and communication of the benefits of degree accreditation
(in both the UK and internationally), as well as action to address the
challenges for both professional bodies and memorandum organisations
to ensure they maintain their relevance in the context of ongoing
global disruption from COVID-19 to learners, institutions, employers
and society as a whole.
